# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IN-AZUR

 machine learning model in Azure involves capturing key information about the model, its performance, and deployment details. Here is a general template for summarizing a machine learning model in Azure:
 1)Model Overview:
   -Name of the model.
   -Purpose and objectives of the model.
   -Type of machine learning model (e.g., classification, regression).

 2)Data Used:
    -Description of the dataset used for training and testing.
    -Data preprocessing steps (e.g., cleaning, feature engineering).

 3)Model Training:
    -Training algorithm used.
    -Hyperparameters and their values.
    -Training performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

 4)Model Evaluation:
    -Evaluation metrics on test data.
    -Comparison with baseline models or previous versions.

 5)Deployment Information:
    -Framework or service used for deployment (e.g., Azure ML, Azure Kubernetes Service).
    -Deployment environment details (e.g., cloud or edge deployment).
